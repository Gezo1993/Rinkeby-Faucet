#This is my first ever Ethereum dapp!!!
It is my first time woking with Ethereum and writing a Solidity smart contract and I must say,
it has been an amazing experience. 

From Coding a full react application and then linking it to the Solidity faucet contract using ethers.js,
the learning process has been quite fullfilling.

I am looking forwrd to conntinue learnig new things in this space and continue to push for higher acnievements
